# Resend Email Setup for Password Reset

## ✅ Already Configured!

Your Resend email system is already set up and working with the API key: `re_6b8a9G78_9jjmGykyMhybiCANMADTQDYE`

## 🚀 What's Working

- ✅ Resend API integration
- ✅ Password reset email functionality  
- ✅ Professional email templates
- ✅ Secure token-based reset system
- ✅ 1-hour token expiration
- ✅ Email sent from: `onboarding@resend.dev`

## ⚠️ Important: Resend Free Tier Limitation

**Current Issue:** Resend's free tier only allows sending emails to your own email address (`asanchir59@gmail.com`) when using `onboarding@resend.dev`.

**Current Setup:** All password reset emails are sent to `asanchir59@gmail.com` for testing purposes.

## 🔧 To Fix for Production

1. **Verify Your Domain** on Resend:
   - Go to [resend.com/domains](https://resend.com/domains)
   - Add and verify your domain (e.g., `yourdomain.com`)

2. **Update the Code**:
   ```typescript
   // Change from:
   from: "onboarding@resend.dev"
   to: "asanchir59@gmail.com"
   
   // To:
   from: "noreply@yourdomain.com"
   to: email  // User's actual email
   ```

## 📧 Test the Current System

1. Go to `/reset-password` page
2. Enter any email (e.g., `k2naysaa@gmail.com`)
3. Check `asanchir59@gmail.com` for the reset link
4. Click the link and set a new password

## 🎯 Features

- **Security**: No email enumeration (doesn't reveal if email exists)
- **Tokens**: Cryptographically secure random tokens
- **Expiration**: 1-hour token validity
- **Cleanup**: Tokens cleared after successful reset
- **Validation**: Password confirmation and length requirements
- **UI**: Responsive design matching your platform theme

## 🚨 Production Notes

For production deployment:
1. **Must verify domain** on Resend
2. **Update `from` address** to your verified domain
3. **Change `to` address** back to user's email
4. **Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`** to your production URL

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

- Check `asanchir59@gmail.com` for test emails
- Verify domain verification in Resend dashboard
- Ensure MongoDB connection is working
- Check server logs for detailed error messages
