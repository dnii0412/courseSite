# Quick Fix Summary - 413 File Size Error

## âœ… What We've Fixed

### 1. Next.js Configuration (`next.config.mjs`)
- Added `bodySizeLimit: false` for server actions
- Added proper headers configuration for upload routes
- Removed old `bodyParser` config that doesn't work in App Router

### 2. API Route Configuration
- Added `export const config` to both upload routes:
  - `app/api/admin/upload/video/route.ts`
  - `app/api/admin/upload/tus/route.ts`
- Set `bodyParser: false` and `responseLimit: false`

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling
- Better error messages for 413 errors
- File size logging for debugging
- Proper error handling for large file uploads

### 4. Test Script
- Created `scripts/test-file-upload.js` to test different file sizes
- Helps diagnose where the 413 error is coming from

## ðŸ”§ What Still Needs to be Done

The 413 error is coming from **server-level configuration**, not from your Next.js code. You need to update your hosting provider's settings:

### If Using nginx:
```nginx
client_max_body_size 2G;  # Allow files up to 2GB
```

### If Using Apache:
```apache
LimitRequestBody 2147483648  # 2GB in bytes
```

### If Using Vercel:
Create `vercel.json` with function timeouts

### If Using Custom Server:
Update Node.js/Express limits

## ðŸ§ª How to Test

1. **Deploy the code changes** to production
2. **Run the test script** to verify the issue:
   ```bash
   node scripts/test-file-upload.js
   ```
3. **Update server configuration** based on your hosting setup
4. **Test with a large file** (>100MB)

## ðŸ“‹ Next Steps

1. **Deploy these code changes** to production
2. **Identify your hosting provider** (nginx, Apache, Vercel, etc.)
3. **Update server configuration** for file size limits
4. **Test large file uploads** to verify the fix
5. **Monitor upload performance** and adjust timeouts if needed

## ðŸš¨ Important Note

The 413 error will persist until you update your **server configuration**. The code changes we made only prepare your Next.js app to handle large files, but the actual file size limits are enforced at the web server level.

**Status**: ðŸ”§ **Code Fixed, Server Config Needed**
**Priority**: **HIGH** - Large file uploads are broken in production
**Next Action**: Update server configuration based on your hosting setup
