# File Size Restrictions Removed for Video Lesson Uploads

## Overview

File size restrictions have been completely removed for video lesson uploads in the New Era Platform. Users can now upload video files of any size without limitations.

## Changes Made

### 1. TUS Upload Route (`app/api/admin/upload/tus/route.ts`)
- **Removed**: Hardcoded 100MB file size limit
- **Added**: Log message indicating no size restrictions
- **Result**: No server-side file size validation for video uploads

### 2. Next.js Configuration (`next.config.mjs`)
- **Added**: `bodyParser.sizeLimit: false` to disable body size limits
- **Added**: `responseLimit: false` to disable response size limits
- **Added**: `experimental.serverComponentsExternalPackages` for better file handling

### 3. Admin Settings (`app/admin/settings/page.tsx`)
- **Changed**: Default `maxFileSize` from 100 to 0 (0 = no limit)
- **Updated**: Label to indicate "0 = хязгааргүй" (0 = unlimited)
- **Added**: Helper text explaining that 0 removes file size restrictions

### 4. Database Defaults (`lib/database.ts`)
- **Changed**: Default `maxFileSize` from 100 to 0 (0 = no limit)

### 5. UI Text Updates
- **Admin Courses Page**: Changed "Max size: 100MB" to "No file size restrictions"
- **Backup Files**: Updated all references to reflect no size limits

### 6. Documentation Updates
- **BUNNY_NET_SETUP.md**: Updated to reflect no file size restrictions
- **Removed**: References to 100MB limits and file size considerations

## Technical Details

### File Size Handling
- **Before**: Hardcoded 100MB limit enforced at API level
- **After**: No size restrictions, unlimited file uploads allowed
- **Validation**: Only file type validation remains (MP4, AVI, MOV, WMV, FLV, WebM)

### Next.js Configuration
```javascript
api: {
  bodyParser: {
    sizeLimit: false, // Disable body size limit
  },
  responseLimit: false, // Disable response size limit
}
```

### Settings Configuration
- **maxFileSize: 0** means no file size restrictions
- **maxFileSize: > 0** would enforce that limit in MB (if needed in future)

## Benefits

1. **Unlimited Uploads**: Users can upload videos of any size
2. **Better UX**: No more "file too large" errors for large video files
3. **Flexibility**: Supports high-quality, long-form video content
4. **Future-Proof**: No need to adjust limits for different video formats

## Considerations

### Server Resources
- **Memory**: Large files will consume more server memory during upload
- **Storage**: Bunny.net handles video storage, not your server
- **Bandwidth**: Upload times will be longer for very large files

### Bunny.net Limits
- Bunny.net may have their own file size limits
- Check Bunny.net documentation for any platform-specific restrictions
- Consider implementing chunked uploads for extremely large files if needed

### Monitoring
- Monitor server performance with large file uploads
- Consider implementing progress indicators for large uploads
- Watch for timeout issues with very large files

## Testing

To test the changes:

1. **Restart your development server** after the Next.js config changes
2. **Try uploading a large video file** (>100MB) through the admin interface
3. **Check console logs** for "no size limit enforced" messages
4. **Verify uploads complete** without size-related errors

## Rollback

If you need to restore file size restrictions:

1. **Restore the size check** in `app/api/admin/upload/tus/route.ts`
2. **Change `maxFileSize` back to 100** in settings and database
3. **Update UI text** to show size limits again
4. **Remove the Next.js API configuration** for size limits

## Security Notes

- **File type validation** remains in place to prevent malicious uploads
- **Admin-only access** to upload functionality is maintained
- **No file size restrictions** means larger potential attack vectors
- **Monitor uploads** for unusual patterns or abuse
